<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About STARS

In a galaxy far away. the STAR organisation manages a number of resorts offering space travel and recreation facilities. These resorts always consist of a number of worlds offering different leisure facilities. Each world is connected by shuttles to some of the other worlds at the resort. A card must be used to take a shuttle to journey to another world. Credits can be bought for cards and these are used when making a shuttle journey. However, there are a number of conditions which need to be met before anyone (card) can use a card for a shuttle journey.  

Recently, a number of incidents have occurred, which have convinced STAR that they need a better control system: someone who needed to be contacted urgently could not be located, a number of people were able to shuttle to worlds to which they were not entitled, and the Health & Safety Council is concerned about STARâ€™s ability to ensure  safety in the event of a major incident. This project will initially be implemented at the Wayward Asteroids Resort
